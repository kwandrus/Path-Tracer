# Path-Tracer
Base program was written by Steven Parker at the University of Utah. This program expands on my Distributed Ray Tracer program to implement shadow penumbra and global path tracing effects with area light sources, thereby exhibiting color shading effects from diffuse reflections of neighboring colored surfaces. The maximum ray depth is 4 and the number of samples per pixel is 100.
