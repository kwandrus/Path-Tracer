# Path-Tracer
Base program was written by Steven Parker at the University of Utah. This program expands on my [Distributed Ray Tracer program](https://github.com/kwandrus/Distributed-Ray-Tracer) to implement shadow penumbra and global path tracing effects with area light sources, thereby exhibiting color shading effects from diffuse reflections of neighboring colored surfaces. The maximum ray depth is 4 and the number of samples per pixel is 100.
